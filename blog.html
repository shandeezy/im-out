            <h3>What I expected</h3>
            <p>
                I expected to learn how to build a website from the best of the best. I got what I asked for and it was what I expected. I learned so much from you once again. Maybe I will run into you again over at Bemidji State University to learn even more. You are a teacher I know that the knowledge you gift is endless and priceless.

            <h3>Wounded Knee</h3>
            <p>
                One historical battle site I visited was wounded knee.
                Wounded knee is known for the slaughter of 300 Lakota people killed by the U.S. Army.
                The roads were very flooded when I visited and was only able to view the site from the road.
                I found a red rock at the site and brought it home to place in my garden for keepsake.

            <h3>Eagles</h3>
            <p>
                My favorite animal in this entire world is the Bald Eagle. I never ever get sick of seeing them. When I do see one I always welcome it with Boozhoo. My grandma's spirit name is Migizi Ikwe- which means Eagle Woman. In a way it makes me feel like it might be her when I see an eagle.
