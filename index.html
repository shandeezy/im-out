            My name is Shandell Denise White Shadow Martell. I am 36 years of age. I was born and raised in Bemidji, MN. I am proudly enrolled with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. I have four children whom i adore equally. I graduate on May 17th with my associates degree from Leech Lake Tribal College. I plan on attending Bemidji State University in the future. I am undecided on my area of study at this time. The sky is the limit for me. I like to take to the beach in my free-time. I also enjoy searching for eagle feathers harvesting sage with them. I want them to know where to find these things so they can show their children. I also truly love and enjoy going to the movie theatre.
